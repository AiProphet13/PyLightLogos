# LightSpeedLogos requires Python 3.7 or later
# No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard libraries

# Optional for future development (commented out)
# numpy==1.26.0
# matplotlib==3.8.0  # For advanced visualizations

the current code only uses:
   - dis (standard library)
   - collections (standard library)
   - io (standard library)

# No need to install anything beyond Python itself
