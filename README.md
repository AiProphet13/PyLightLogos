# PyLightLogos

Transform Python code into a visual symbolic language that reveals its architectural essence. 
This project analyzes bytecode patterns, optimizes them into computational primitives, 
and represents them as visual symbols for instant comprehension.

## Features

- **Bytecode Pattern Analysis**: Detect recurring instruction sequences
- **Multi-stage Optimization**: Compress code into macros and super-macros
- **Visual Symbol System**: Represent computational patterns with meaningful symbols
- **Architecture Fingerprinting**: Visualize code essence through pattern frequencies
- **Compression Metrics**: Reduce code to its fundamental elements

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PyLightLogos
.git
cd PyLightLogos
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from src.pipeline import analyze_code

code = """
def calculate(a, b):
    return a * b + 10
"""

results = analyze_code(code)
print("Visual representation:", " ".join(results['logos']))
print("\nArchitecture fingerprint:\n", results['fingerprint'])
```

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for sample analyses:
```bash
python examples/sample_analysis.py
```

## Tests

Run the test suite:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
